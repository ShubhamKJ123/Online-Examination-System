# Online-Examination-System
This is my Microsoft FRT Internship Project

# Project Statement
Online Examination System aims to provide a robust, user-friendly, and secure platform for conducting exams online, reducing the administrative burden, and offering a more efficient examination process for educational institutions.
The system aims to address the challenges faced in traditional paper-based examinations and provide a user-friendly experience to both administrators and students.

# Project Description
Online Examination System is a Java-based application developed using Swing, AWT, and event handling. The main objective of this project is to create a comprehensive and efficient online platform for conducting examinations in a digital environment.

* Login Interface: The login interface ensures that only registered candidates can access the examination. This helps maintain the security and authenticity of the exam.
* Rules and Guidelines Interface: Before starting the exam, candidates are presented with a clear set of rules and guidelines that they must follow during the examination. This ensures that all candidates have a consistent understanding of the exam's rules and expectations.
* Examination Interface: The main examination interface provides a user-friendly platform for candidates to view and attempt the questions. The questions may be randomized, reducing the chances of cheating and enhancing the exam's fairness.
* Timer and Auto-Submission: The system incorporates a timer that limits the duration for which candidates can attempt the exam. This ensures that candidates complete the exam within the specified time frame.
